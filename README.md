# BrainFudge interpreter

## Added features
/index\ will jump into the [index] cell

example usage:
/544\ jumps into cell 544 without you having to do + 544 times

### Keep in mind

#### index
anything called index is a cells number. By doing `+`, you jump one cell up etc.
the first cell has an index of 0, not 1.
